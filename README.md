# 📘 **Tasks Overview**

Below is a summary of all tasks completed (Task 1 to Task 4):

---

# 🟦 **Task 1 – Caesar Cipher Encryption Tool**

A simple cryptographic program that encrypts or decrypts text using the Caesar Cipher, one of the oldest and simplest encryption techniques.

### 🔑 Features

* Shifts characters by a key value
* Preserves upper/lowercase
* Ignores non-alphabet characters
* Includes encryption and decryption

📁 Folder: `Task1-Caesar-Cipher/`
📄 Contains: `caesar_cipher.py` & README

---

# 🟩 **Task 2 – Image Encryption Tool**

A basic image encryption and decryption tool using pixel manipulation.
Uses OpenCV to perform:

### 🔐 Features

* Swapping of RGB channels
* Arithmetic encryption using a key
* Decryption restores image
* Supports PNG/JPG
* Includes sample image

📁 Folder: `Task2-Image-Encryption-Tool/`
📄 Contains: `encrypt.py`, `decrypt.py`, `utils.py`, `sample-images/`

---

# 🟧 **Task 3 – Password Strength Assessment Tool**

A password strength checker that evaluates a password based on standard security criteria.

### 🔎 Checks Include:

* Length >= 8
* Uppercase letters
* Lowercase letters
* Numbers
* Special characters
* Overall score & strength rating

📁 Folder: `Task3-Password-Strength-Tool/`
📄 Contains: `password_strength.py`, README

---

# 🟥 **Task 4 – Keylogger (Educational Use Only)**

A basic keylogger built using Python's `pynput` library, created strictly for educational purposes to learn about how keylogging works in cybersecurity.

### 📝 Features

* Records every key pressed
* Saves logs to `keylogs.txt`
* Timestamps each logging session
* Stops logging when **ESC** key is pressed
* Demonstrates monitoring/detection concepts

📁 Folder: `Task4-Keylogger/`
📄 Contains: `keylogger.py`, `keylogs.txt`, README
